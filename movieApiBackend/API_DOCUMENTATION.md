## Recommendation Algorithm Details

### 1. Basic Recommendations (`/recommendations`)
- Analyzes user's high-rated movies (4-5 stars)
- Finds movies in similar categories
- Calculates recommendation score based on:
  - 60% weight to average rating
  - 30% bonus for high ratings (4+ stars)
  - 10% bonus for number of ratings

### 2. Advanced Recommendations (`/recommendations/advanced`)
- Finds users with similar rating patterns
- Calculates user similarity using rating correlation
- Recommends movies that similar users rated highly
- Scoring considers:
  - 50% weight to similar users' average rating
  - 30% weight to number of similar users who rated
  - 20% weight to overall movie rating

### 3. Category-Based Recommendations (`/recommendations/category`)
- Analyzes user's category preferences
- Identifies under-explored categories
- Promotes diversity in recommendations
- Scoring considers:
  - 70% weight to average rating
  - 10% weight to number of ratings
  - 20% bonus for high-rated movies

### 4. Comprehensive Recommendations (`/recommendations/comprehensive`)
- Combines all three methods
- Deduplicates results
- Provides method statistics
- Fallback to basic method if others fail
